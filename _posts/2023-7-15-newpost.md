## Kolmogorov Equations
In this section, We introduce the Kolmogorov forward/backward equations. In general, there are three but related views when studying the diffusion processes. 

1. Pathwise view. Each path is represented by the solution of an SDE. 
2. Through studying the dynamics of the probability distributions and the related expectation values using the partial differential equations. 
3. Study the probability distribution on path space induced by the diffusion processes (path integral).


### Kolmogorov Forward equations
For simplicity, we only consider the one dimensional case, higher dimensional results can be derived similarly. 
The starting point is the following SDE: 

$$
\begin{align}
	dX_t = b(X_t,t)dt + \sigma(X_t, t) dW_t
\end{align}
$$

Suppose at a time $t \geq s$, the particle is located at $(s, y)$, then the probability of the particle falling in the interval $[x,x+dx)$ is the following: 

$$
\begin{align}
	p(x, t| y ,s) dx= \mathbb{P}(X_t \in [x,x+dx) | X_s=y)
\end{align}
$$

Then by applying It√¥'s formula to the function $f\in C_c(\mathbb{R})$, one has 

$$
\begin{align}
	df(X_t)&= f'(X_t) dX_t + \frac{1}{2} f''(X_t) \sigma^2 dt \nonumber\\
	  &= \bigg(f'(X_t)b(X_t,t)+\frac{1}{2} f''(X_t) \sigma^2(X_t, t) \bigg) dt + f'(X_t) \sigma(X_t, t) dW_t
\end{align}
$$

Integrating both side of the equations from $s$ to $t$ and take conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}^{y,s}[]:=\mathbb{E}[\cdot | X_s=y]$
we have the following: 

$$
\begin{align}
	\mathbb{E}^{y,s}[f(X_t)]-f(y)=\mathbb{E}^{y,s}[\int^t_s \mathcal{L}f(X_r,r) dr]
\end{align}
$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the infinitesimal generator

$$
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}(X_t,t)=f'(X_t)b(X_t,t)+\frac{1}{2} f''(X_t) \sigma^2(X_t, t)
\end{align}
$$

As such, the conditional expectation can be also written as 

$$
\begin{align}
	\int f(x) p(x, t|y,s) dx=f(y) + \int \int^t_s \mathcal{L}f(x,r) p(x, r|y,s) dr dx
\end{align}
$$

Applying integration by part, we have 

$$
\begin{align}
	\int f(x) p(x, t|y,s) dx=f(y) + \int \int^t_s f(x,r) \mathcal{L}^*p(x, r|y,s) dr dx
\end{align}
$$

where $\mathcal{L}^*$ is the adjoint operator of $\mathcal{L}$ and it takes the form  \\( \int x dx = \frac{x^2}{2} + C \\)

$$
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}^*f(x,t)= -\partial_x \big(f(x)b(x,t) \big)+\frac{1}{2} \partial^2_x \big(f(x)\sigma^2(x, t)\big)
\end{align}
$$
